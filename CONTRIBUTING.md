This allows you to edit the file in Markdown. Just add the information of a paper to the corresponding list in the same format. After making changes, click the "Preview Changes" tab at the top of the page to ensure that the list can still be displayed normally. If everything looks good, go to the bottom of the page and you will see the following table.
